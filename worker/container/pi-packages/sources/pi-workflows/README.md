# pi-workflows

Local Pi package extracted from [`davis7dotsh/my-pi-setup`](https://github.com/davis7dotsh/my-pi-setup) for personal evaluation.

It provides model-authored, multi-agent workflows with deterministic draft previews, ordered phases, bounded parallel fan-out, structured outputs, concurrent background execution, clean cancellation, persisted artifacts, and a permission-restricted JavaScript orchestration sandbox.

## Install locally

```sh
pi install /Users/yesh/code/personal/pi-workflows
```

Reload an existing Pi session with `/reload`.

## Interface

- `workflow` tool: submit `{ preview, script, args?, background? }` to prepare an immutable draft; after a newer user response, submit `{ draftId }` to execute it
- `workflow_cancel` tool: abort one exact active run and wait for clean settlement
- `/workflow-draft [draftId]` source-split review for pending immutable drafts
- `/workflows` dashboard and run inspection
- DSL primitives: `phase()`, `agent()`, `parallel()`, and `args`

Drafts are written under `~/.pi/agent/workflows/drafts/<draftId>/draft.json`; run artifacts are written under `~/.pi/agent/workflows/<runId>/`. Run `/workflow-draft <draftId>` to review the plan and exact immutable source side by side; pressing `a` only prefills an explicit approval message for you to submit. Multiple approved background workflows share a process-global capacity pool.

## Development

```sh
npm install
npm run check
npm test
```

## Provenance and licensing
